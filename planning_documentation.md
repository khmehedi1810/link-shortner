<h1 align="center">URL Shortener Project Planning Documentation</h1>


## Introduction

The URL shortener project aims to provide a service where users can input long URLs and receive shortened versions. This documentation outlines the plan for building the URL shortening service using Laravel, MySql, ReactJS, Inertia, and Tailwind. The implementation will follow the repository pattern for better code organization and maintainability.

## Objectives

- Develop a robust URL shortening service.
- Utilize Laravel for backend development.
- Use MySql for database storage.
- Implement the frontend using ReactJS and Inertia for seamless interactions.
- Design a user-friendly interface with Tailwind CSS.
- Apply the repository pattern for better code organization and separation of concerns.

## Technologies Stack

- Laravel: A PHP web application framework for backend development.
- MySql: A relational database management system for data storage.
- ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Inertia: A library for building single-page apps with server-side frameworks.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive web interfaces.

## Project Structure
The project will be structured as follows:

### Backend (Laravel)

- Controllers: Handle incoming HTTP requests and control the flow of the application.
- Services: Contains business logic for URL shortening.
- Repositories: Implement the repository pattern for data access.
- Models: Define database schema and interact with the database.
- Routes: Define API endpoints for URL shortening.

### Frontend (ReactJS with Inertia)

- Components: Reusable UI components for building the frontend.
- Pages: Define individual pages/routes of the application.
- Layouts: Define the overall layout structure of the application.
- Views: React components that render the UI based on data from the backend
